# Testing images update is a bit tricky since in the docker world, tags don't
# follow any versioning--latest doesn't really mean latest.  Docker and skopeo
# determine if there is an updated image based on the docker image layers.
# In order to test images update, this test uses a private registry and tag
# manipulation in order to commit and push new layers to the private registry
# then update the image.

# Setup the private registry
