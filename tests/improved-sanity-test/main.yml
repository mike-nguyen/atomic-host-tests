# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# !!!NOTE!!! This playbook was tested using Ansible 2.1; it is recommended
# that the same version is used.
#
# This playbook is actually multiple playbooks contained in a single file.
# I had to take this approach, because I encountered difficulties re-using
# the same roles with non-unique variables.  Sometimes the roles would be
# executed with the use of the 'always' tag, sometimes not.
#
# The wrinkle in this approach is that sharing global variables across the
# multiple playbooks requires the use of a file containing the variables
# which is included in each playbook with the 'vars_files' directive.
#
# The sanity tests performed in this set of playbooks:
#   - check permissions on /tmp are correct (RHBZ 1276775) after each reboot
#   - add user to system, verify it is present after upgrade
#   - make changes to /etc, verify changes are present after upgrade
#   - add directory/file to /var, verify they persist after upgrade/rollback
#   - add user post-upgrade, verify it is not present after rollback
#   - add directory/file to /var post-upgrade, verify they persist after
#     rollback
#
# The intent is to expand the sanity test coverage in this set of playbooks
# with small, focused tests going forward.  Additional functional tests that
# are more expansive should be handled in separate playbooks.
