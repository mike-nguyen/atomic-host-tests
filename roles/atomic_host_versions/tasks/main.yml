# vim: set ft=ansible:
#
# Parameters:
#  ahv_rpms: (optional) list of rpms
#   Example:
#     ahv_rpms
#       - atomic
#       - docker
#
#  ahv_requirements: dictionary with key:value pair of rpm:expected version
#    Example:
#      ahv_requirements:
#        docker: 1.12
#        rpm-ostree: 2017.9
#
# This role, with no parameters, will store version information for the list of
# rpms in ahv_rpms to a dictionary named g_atomic_host.  ahv_rpms has default
# values in the defaults directory of this role.
#
# Optionally, ahv_rpms can be passed into this role to override the defaults.
# The g_atomic_host dictionary is useful for conditional statements when
# functionality is different between older/newer version of a package. Use the
# version_compare filter for these conditionals.
#
# Another optional parameter is a dictionary named ahv_requirements which should
# contain a key / value pair (rpm:  minimum version).  This role should fail if
# the minimum version is not met.
#
- name: Set requirements
  set_fact:
    ahv_requirements: "{{ ahv_requirements | default({}) }}"

# Get set of rpms that were not alreayd retrieved when this role was called
- name: Get set of of missing rpms
  set_fact:
    ahv_missing_rpms: "{{ ahv_requirements.keys() | difference(ahv_rpms) }}"

- name: Get versions if they were not retrieved
  when: ahv_missing_rpms|length > 0
  include_role:
    name: rpm_version
  vars:
    rv_rpms: "{{ ahv_missing_rpms }}"

- name: Fail if version requirement is not met
  when:
    - g_atomic_host[item.key] | version_compare(item.value, '<')
    - g_atomic_host[item.key] is defined
  fail:
    msg: |
      Expected: {{ item.key }} is running version {{ ahv_requirements[item.key] }}
      Actual: {{ item.key }} is running {{ g_atomic_host[item.key] }}
